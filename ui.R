                  trust in the government, and dystopia residual (a comparison to an imaginary country of the worldâ€™s least happy people).
                  The scores in each of these criteria are then used to determine an overall happiness score for each country. We are then 
                  going to compare this data to World Bank information about median income, economic wealth, and other such financial data

                 Using this alone is not a valid means of declaring that the two are directly associated, but it gives us good reason to 
                 investigate a possible relationship. This pattern is one that many people would likely anticipate given that associating
                 doing well and happiness is common.")
