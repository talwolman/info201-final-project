## Project Description
We are analyzing two separate data sets: a World Happiness Index and a World Bank Data. The World Happiness Index is a list of different aspects that are viewed to lead to happiness. These include life expectancy, freedom, generosity, trust in the government, and dystopia residual (a comparison to an imaginary country of the world's least happy people). The scores in each of these criteria are then used to determine an overall happiness score for each country. We are then going to compare this data to World Bank information about median income, economic wealth, and other such financial data in order to ascertain if money can indeed lead to happiness.

We are doing this by answering four basic questions:
1. Is a dramatic change in the economic situation of a country also reflected in the happiness of that country?
2. Is there a correlation between the wealth and happiness of the different regions around the country? Are happier regions also necessarily wealthier?
3. What is the relationship between income bracket (Low, Lower Middle, Upper Middle, and High) and average happiness? What about for the brackets for GDP per capita? Does personal wealth (income) or national wealth (GDP per capita) have a stronger relationship with happiness?
4.

Each of these questions is answered and accompanied with an interactive visualization in order to allow users to understand the information more easily and more deeply.
